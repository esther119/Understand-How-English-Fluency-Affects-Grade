    "Answer: I would give this a 2 because I think this requires significant revision. It is close to a three as it stands now. Is your thought that decentralization and egalitarianism is utopian? If so, I would say that. Is your thought also that committing to these principles leads to better consequences? If so, say that\n",

    "Example prompt 2: The skewed public perception of cloning to see it as only the creation of an identical individual has resulted in an unfair public bias against therapeutic cloning, slowing down its scientific development. It is a good example since it brings an issue that is debatable, it goes into a topic that isn't too vague and it makes a substantial claim about the result of public perceptions on the development of therapeutic cloning. The meaning of the claim itself is also clear and easy to understand but not having a definition for therapeutic cloning might make it inaccessible to some.\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer: I would give this a 3 because this takes a clear position, although I am not sure you explicitly state a policy or solution. This is implied (correct the public perception or don't slow down its development). I also think you could make this much more concise. Because you refer to 'public perception', you do not need to refer to 'to see it as only'. You could just say, 'The public perceives cloning as the creation of identical individuals, which wrongly slows the progress of therapeutic cloning.\n",

This is done by presenting the humane characteristics of clones as evidence for them being human. In these clones' humane upbringing, a critical aspect of human nature that comes to light is that hope derived from a false narrative forms the basis for seemingly illogical behavior.\n",
